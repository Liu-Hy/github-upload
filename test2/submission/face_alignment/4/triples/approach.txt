(Approach||develop||Self - Iterative Regression ( SIR ) framework)
(one regressor||to learn||descent directions)
(descent directions||in||coarse and fine stages)
(Approach||By means of||Convolutional Neural Network ( CNN ))
(discriminative landmarks features||proposed||Landmarks - Attention Network ( LAN ))
(Landmarks - Attention Network ( LAN )||focuses on||appearance)
(appearance||around||landmarks)
(discriminative landmarks features||name||Landmarks - Attention Network ( LAN ))
(Approach||to obtain||discriminative landmarks features)
(holistic increment||significantly reduces||dimension)
(holistic increment||significantly reduces||number of model parameters)
(dimension||of||final feature layer)
(dimension||of||number of model parameters)
(Approach||concurrently extracts||local landmarks ' features)
(Contribution||has||Approach)
