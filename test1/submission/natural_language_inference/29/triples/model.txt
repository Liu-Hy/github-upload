(general framework PhaseCond||for the use of||multiple attention layers)
(Model||introduce||general framework PhaseCond)
(different attention - based architecture||containing||two sequential phases)
(different attention - based architecture||name||two sequential phases)
(two sequential phases||name||question - aware passage representation phase)
(Model||leads to||different attention - based architecture)
(several meaningful trends||during||questionpassage attention phase)
(several meaningful trends||during||self - attention phase)
(questionpassage attention phase||repeatedly attending||passage)
(passage||with||same question representation)
(same question representation||forces||each passage word)
(each passage word||to become||increasingly closer)
(several meaningful trends||during||self - attention phase)
(self - attention 's alignment weights||of||second layer)
(self - attention 's alignment weights||become||noticeably " sharper ")
(second layer||become||noticeably " sharper ")
(noticeably " sharper "||than||first layer)
(self - attention phase||has||self - attention 's alignment weights)
(self - attention 's alignment weights||has||second layer)
(Model||observe||several meaningful trends)
(Contribution||has||Model)
